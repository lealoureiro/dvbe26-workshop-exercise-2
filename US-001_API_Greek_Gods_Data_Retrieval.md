**User Story ID:** US-001  
**Feature ID:** FEAT-001  
**Epic ID:** EPIC-001

## User Story Statement

**As an** API consumer/developer  
**I want to** retrieve Greek god records through a REST API endpoint  
**So that** I can integrate synchronized mythology data into my application.

---

## Business Value

The API provides a stable local read model for Greek gods that is periodically
synchronized from a third-party JSON service. Consumers can read generated
identifiers and names from the local database without depending on the external
service at request time.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

This user story is linked to detailed acceptance criteria in the Gherkin feature
file: [US-001_api_greek_gods_data_retrieval.feature](US-001_api_greek_gods_data_retrieval.feature)

### Summary of Key Acceptance Criteria

1. **Successful Data Retrieval**
   - `GET /api/v1/gods/greek` returns a list of Greek god records.
   - Successful responses use `application/json`.
   - Each record contains `id` as an integer and `name` as a string.

2. **Known Record Verification**
   - The response can include a synchronized record for Zeus.
   - Existing database rows keep their current `id`.

3. **Data Synchronization Rules**
   - The external service returns Greek god names as a JSON array of strings.
   - The internal database maps those names to records with generated IDs.
   - `name` is the natural key during synchronization.
   - New names are inserted; existing names are retained without changing IDs.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Successful retrieval returns `200 OK`.
   - Server failures return `500 Internal Server Error`.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `GET /api/v1/gods/greek` endpoint implemented and functional.
- [ ] Successful response format is validated as a JSON array of objects.
- [ ] Each Greek god record exposes `id` and `name`.
- [ ] Synchronization upserts external names by natural key `name`.
- [ ] Existing rows keep stable IDs across synchronization runs.
- [ ] OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification matches the implementation.
- [ ] Database schema includes `greek_god(id, name)` with unique `name`.
- [ ] Gherkin scenarios pass acceptance testing.

---

## Dependencies

- PostgreSQL persistence using the `greek_god` table.
- Background synchronization from
  `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems/greek`.

---

## Notes

- **Data Source:** PostgreSQL database with synchronized Greek god data.
- **Authentication:** Public API; no authentication required for this endpoint.
- **API Version:** v1 with path-based versioning.
- **Expected Success Payload:** Array of records shaped as `{ "id": 1, "name": "Zeus" }`.
